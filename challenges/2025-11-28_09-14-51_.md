# Challenge: Balanced Relative Subarrays

## Description
You are given an array `A` of `N` integers. A subarray `A[L...R]` (where `0 <= L <= R < N`) is considered "balanced" if the sum of elements at relatively even indices within the subarray equals the sum of elements at relatively odd indices within the subarray.

Specifically, for a subarray `A[L...R]`:
*   An element `A[k]` is at a *relatively even index* if `(k - L)` is an even number.
*   An element `A[k]` is at a *relatively odd index* if `(k - L)` is an odd number.

Your task is to count the total number of balanced subarrays.

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer `N`, the size of the array.
The second line contains `N` space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array `A`.

## Output Format
Print a single integer, the total count of balanced subarrays.

## Constraints
*   `1 <= N <= 10^5`
*   `-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
*   Time Limit: 2 seconds
*   Memory Limit: 256 MB
